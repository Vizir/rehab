# Rehab

Rehab helps you deal with your coffee dependency

## Why do you think you're here?

If you need to work with multiples CoffeeScript files and need to join then into a single JavaScript file at the end, Rehab is wating for you. 

You won't immediately realize you have a problem. Just a few .coffee files here and there and all you need is ```coffee --join``` to make it work.

Then, one day, you realize you need more! You need your files to have order or it won't work properly. And that little friend transpiler [won't help](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2673#issuecomment-12372037). You start making maneuvers, like huge Cakefiles, file lists(!) or even put your files in alphabetic order (!!!). But one day you stop and think "There should be a better way to do that! I need help!"

Yes, we know... That's why we are here.


## No, no, no!

Rehab deals with coffeescript dependency using a simple tag ```#_require [filename]``` on the file that have dependencies.

```coffeescript
#_require ../filenameA.coffee
#_require ../filenameB.coffee

class app.Model2

```

With that on your troublesome files and Rehab will give you a list of files in the right order so you can use it, for instance, with your Cakefile:

```coffeescript
{exec} = require 'child_process'
Rehab = require 'rehab'

task 'build', 'Build coffee2js using Rehab', sbuild = ->
  console.log "Building project from src/*.coffee to lib/app.js"

  files = new Rehab().process './src'
  
  to_single_file = "--join lib/app.js"
  from_files = "--compile #{files.join ' '}"

  exec "coffee #{to_single_file} #{from_files}", (err, stdout, stderr) ->
    throw err if err
```
